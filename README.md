# NodeNet
NodeNet is a web-app that is written with only standard web development. 

It is made this way so that it is simple, easy to understand, compatable with chromebooks, and can be tailored by the user.

NodeNet allows users to access small but enjoyable things like easy screen recording, simplistic HTML5 games, and others. This repo contains the full copy, with the future exception of a couple private or custom nodes.

Node list:

- GameNode : Gamenode contains a few games. Per below:
  1. Kazoo Clicker : Allows you to click one of the 6 kazoos, or hit the corresponding number on your keyboard, to collect kazoos. Links to Pride CLicker, Old Pride Clicker, and Kazoo Runner. \[May be added to over time]
  2. Pride clicker : A button game where you click one of the pride buttons to gain Respects, which can be traded for upgrades.
  3. Old Pride Clicker : The original, not-so-well-made Pride CLicker.
  4. Kazoo Runner: A simple game like the No Internet T-rex game.

- RandomNode : A bunch of random programs. \[Mostly Finished]
  1. Thingy : A connection between Thingy.html and Thingy2.html; the two files link to all of the following:
  2. Homuse : The half-abandoned, old local database. Links back to Thingy.html.
  3. Square : Though the name is confusing, Square is a simple webpage that attempts to sell you cubic watermelons by threatening you. It's actually safe- just look.
  4. PhyXTGears Timeclock Knockoff : A terrible remake of the FRC Team 1720's timeclock that, unlike the real thing, doesn't actually function.
 
 - RecordNode : A very small but useful node. It has one file, which allows you to record your screen and microphone input for unlimited time (Or at least as long as your computer can manage) and download it. The script was written while following a tutorial. I wrote it because I was frustrated with how hard it is to find good recording software without needing an account/paying for time/having limits/etc.  \[Mostly Functional]

- VersatileNode : Three .html files all linked together, which is actually the coming website for Versatile Services, a super versatile, child owned company! (Three children, to be exact, and I'm one of them) \[Beta Phase]
 
##             NodeNet is in early alpha. All of this is subject to change.
